# Better Beluga

An image change detector, to be used for multiple usecases.

This application will allow for a user to drop in two images, depicting how much change occurs between them.

## Planned Features

- Be able to use both vision detection models, and compare bystreams
- Be hosted on AWS cloud services
- Friendly UI
- LLMs to describe the changes, and what each image is

## Goals

My goal is to complete this project as quickly as possible, having a MVP within 24 hours of total development.

This will also give me some cool experience with AWS, as my cloud services are somewhat limited. Will also help me brush up on some langchain.

NOTE: This could realistically all be done on the client-side with js, but it would be cool to practice some full-stack stuff
